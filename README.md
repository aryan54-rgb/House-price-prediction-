# üè° Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts house prices using **Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)**.  
It is implemented in Python from scratch, without using machine learning libraries.  

---

## Dataset
The notebook uses:  
```

Housing Price data set.csv

````
Make sure the file is in the right path before running.

---

## Requirements
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
````

---

## Usage

1. Open `Main.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells.
3. The model will train and show predicted vs. actual house prices.

---

## Features

* Data preprocessing
* Ridge Regression with:

  * Gradient Descent
  * Normal Equation
* Error comparison for different Œª values

---

## Example Output

```
pred price = 145000, actual price = 142000
```

```

üëâ Do you also want me to make a **short requirements.txt file** for you automatically from the notebook?
